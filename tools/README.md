# SDK OpenAPI Tools

Folder contains scripts, generators and other files required to generate Golang client

## Purpose of the project

Tools provides required scripts and intrastructure for generating source code for [OpenAPI generator project](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).
Typically a client is generated by:

1. Fetching OpenAPI file from different sources
2. Running [transformation](./transformer)) that will process OpenAPI file to simplify outputs of the generated SDKs
3. Generating Client source code
4. Validation and linting for generation process

## Using Tools

### Fetching OpenAPI file

```bash
make fetch_openapi
```

### Generating Go SDK

```bash
make clean_and_generate
```
