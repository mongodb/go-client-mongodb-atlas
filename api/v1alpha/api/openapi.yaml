    Returns, adds, and removes Global Cluster managed namespaces and custom zone mappings. Each collection in a Global Cluster is associated with a managed namespace. When you create a managed namespace for a Global Cluster, MongoDB Cloud creates an empty collection for that namespace. Creating a managed namespace doesn't populate a collection with data. Similarly, deleting a managed namespace doesn't delete the associated collection.
    MongoDB Cloud shards the empty collection using the required location field and a custom shard key. For example, if your custom shard key is `city`, the compound shard key is `location, city`. Each Global Cluster is also associated with one or more Global Writes Zones. When a user creates a Global Cluster, MongoDB Cloud automatically maps each location code to the closest geographical zone. Custom zone mappings allow administrators to override these automatic mappings. For example, a use case might require mapping a location code to a geographically distant zone. Administrators can manage custom zone mappings with the APIs below and the **Global Cluster Configuration** pane when you create or modify your Global Cluster.

When you remove an entry from the IP access list, existing connections from the removed address or addresses may remain open for a variable amount of time.

          If you enabled Encryption at Rest using Customer Key  Management, administrators can pass only the changed fields for the **awsKms**, **azureKeyVault**, or **googleCloudKms** object to update the configuration to this endpoint.

            **NOTE**: After you create a notification which requires an API or integration key, the key appears partially redacted when you:

            * Query the alert for the notification through the Atlas Administration API.

            - Set this value to `true` to enable regionalized private endpoints. This allows you to create more than one private endpoint in a cloud provider region. You need to enable this setting to connect to multi-region and global MongoDB Cloud sharded clusters. Enabling regionalized private endpoints introduces the following limitations:
              - Your applications must use the new connection strings for existing multi-region and global sharded clusters. This might cause downtime.
              - Your MongoDB Cloud project can't contain replica sets nor can you create new replica sets in this project.

              - You can't disable this setting if you have:
                - more than one private endpoint in more than one region
                - more than one private endpoint in one region and one private endpoint in one or more regions.

            - Set this value to `false` to disable regionalized private endpoints.

            IP addresses expressed in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation that MongoDB Cloud uses for the network peering containers in your project. MongoDB Cloud assigns all of the project's clusters deployed to this cloud provider an IP address from this range. MongoDB Cloud locks this value if an M10 or greater cluster or a network peering connection exists in this project.

            These CIDR blocks must fall within the ranges reserved per RFC 1918. AWS and Azure further limit the block to between the `/24` and  `/21` ranges.

            To modify the CIDR block, the target project cannot have:

            - Any M10 or greater clusters
            - Any other VPC peering connections

             You can also create a new project and create a network peering connection to set the desired MongoDB Cloud network peering container CIDR block for that project. MongoDB Cloud limits the number of MongoDB nodes per network peering connection based on the CIDR block and the region selected for the project.

             **Example:** A project in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) region supporting three availability zones and an MongoDB CIDR network peering container block of limit of `/24` equals 27 three-node replica sets.

          description: |-
            IP addresses expressed in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation that MongoDB Cloud uses for the network peering containers in your project. MongoDB Cloud assigns all of the project's clusters deployed to this cloud provider an IP address from this range. MongoDB Cloud locks this value if an M10 or greater cluster or a network peering connection exists in this project.

            These CIDR blocks must fall within the ranges reserved per RFC 1918. AWS and Azure further limit the block to between the `/24` and  `/21` ranges.

            To modify the CIDR block, the target project cannot have:

            - Any M10 or greater clusters
            - Any other VPC peering connections

             You can also create a new project and create a network peering connection to set the desired MongoDB Cloud network peering container CIDR block for that project. MongoDB Cloud limits the number of MongoDB nodes per network peering connection based on the CIDR block and the region selected for the project.

             **Example:** A project in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) region supporting three availability zones and an MongoDB CIDR network peering container block of limit of `/24` equals 27 three-node replica sets.

            Specific pre-defined method chosen to convert database field text into searchable words. This conversion reduces the text of fields into the smallest units of text. These units are called a **term** or **token**. This process, known as tokenization, involves a variety of changes made to the text in fields:

            - extracting words
            - removing punctuation
            - removing accents
            - changing to lowercase
            - removing common words
            - reducing words to their root form (stemming)
            - changing words to their base form (lemmatization)
             MongoDB Cloud uses the selected process to build the Atlas Search index.

            IP addresses expressed in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation that MongoDB Cloud uses for the network peering containers in your project. MongoDB Cloud assigns all of the project's clusters deployed to this cloud provider an IP address from this range. MongoDB Cloud locks this value if an M10 or greater cluster or a network peering connection exists in this project.

            These CIDR blocks must fall within the ranges reserved per RFC 1918. GCP further limits the block to a lower bound of the `/18` range.

            To modify the CIDR block, the target project cannot have:

            - Any M10 or greater clusters
            - Any other VPC peering connections

             You can also create a new project and create a network peering connection to set the desired MongoDB Cloud network peering container CIDR block for that project. MongoDB Cloud limits the number of MongoDB nodes per network peering connection based on the CIDR block and the region selected for the project.

             **Example:** A project in an Google Cloud (GCP) region supporting three availability zones and an MongoDB CIDR network peering container block of limit of `/24` equals 27 three-node replica sets.

            MongoDB Cloud enforces minimum ratios of storage capacity to system memory for given cluster tiers. This keeps cluster performance consistent with large datasets.

            Hardware specifications for nodes set for a given region. Each **regionConfigs** object describes the region's priority in elections and the number and type of MongoDB nodes that MongoDB Cloud deploys to the region. Each **regionConfigs** object must have either an **analyticsSpecs** object, **electableSpecs** object, or **readOnlySpecs** object. Tenant clusters only require **electableSpecs. Dedicated** clusters can specify any of these specifications, but must have at least one **electableSpecs** object within a **replicationSpec**. Every hardware specification must use the same **instanceSize**.
